This repository contains all my solutions to exercises to Responsive Web Design from freeCodecamp course. 

In this course you get introduced to languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, 
and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. 

In addition, learn how to build webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
